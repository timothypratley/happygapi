The actual data are contained in a number of GeoTIFF files covering the requested region, for which this message contains URLs: Each string in the `DataLayers` message contains a URL from which the corresponding GeoTIFF can be fetched. These URLs are valid for a few hours after they've been generated. Most of the GeoTIFF files are at a resolution of 0.1m/pixel, but the monthly flux file is at 0.5m/pixel, and the hourly shade files are at 1m/pixel. If a `pixel_size_meters` value was specified in the `GetDataLayersRequest`, then the minimum resolution in the GeoTIFF files will be that value.",

Each GeoTIFF will contain 24 bands, corresponding to the 24 hours of the day. Each pixel is a 32 bit integer, corresponding to the (up to) 31 days of that month; a 1 bit means that the corresponding location is able to see the sun at that day, of that hour, of that month. Invalid locations are stored as -9999 (since this is negative, it has bit 31 set, and no valid value could have bit 31 set as that would correspond to the 32nd day of the month). An example may be useful. If you want to know whether a point (at pixel location (x, y)) saw sun at 4pm on the 22nd of June you would: 1. fetch the sixth URL in this list (corresponding to June). 1. look up the 17th channel (corresponding to 4pm). 1. read the 32-bit value at (x, y). 1. read bit 21 of the value (corresponding to the 22nd of the month). 1. if that bit is a 1, then that spot saw the sun at 4pm 22 June. More formally: Given `month` (1-12), `day` (1...month max; February has 28 days) and `hour` (0-23), the shade/sun for that month/day/hour at a position `(x, y)` is the bit ``` (hourly_shade[month - 1])(x, y)[hour] & (1 << (day - 1)) ``` where `(x, y)` is spatial indexing, `[month - 1]` refers to fetching the `month - 1`st URL (indexing from zero), `[hour]` is indexing into the channels, and a final non-zero result means \"sunny\". There are no leap days, and DST doesn't exist (all days are 24 hours long; noon is always \"standard time\" noon)."},
