Examples: * File Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix The output files will be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output files will begin with \"filenameprefix\". * Directory Prefix: gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified.

If the `ProductSet` or `Product` specified by the `product-set-id` and `product-id` values does not exist, then the system will create a new `ProductSet` or `Product` for the image. In this case, the `product-display-name` column refers to display_name, the `product-category` column refers to product_category, and the `labels` column refers to product_labels. The `image-id` column is optional but must be unique if provided. If it is empty, the system will automatically assign a unique id to the image. The `product-display-name` column is optional. If it is empty, the system sets the display_name field for the product to a space (\" \"). You can update the `display_name` later by using the API. If a `Product` with the specified `product-id` already exists, then the system ignores the `product-display-name`, `product-category`, and `labels` columns. The `labels` column (optional) is a line containing a list of comma-separated key-value pairs, in the following format: \"key_1=value_1,key_2=value_2,...,key_n=value_n\" The `bounding-poly` column (optional) identifies one region of interest from the image in the same manner as `CreateReferenceImage`. If you do not specify the `bounding-poly` column, then the system will try to detect regions of interest automatically. At most one `bounding-poly` column is allowed per line. If the image contains multiple regions of interest, add a line to the CSV file that includes the same product information, and the `bounding-poly` values for each region of interest. The `bounding-poly` column must contain an even number of comma-separated numbers, in the format \"p1_x,p1_y,p2_x,p2_y,...,pn_x,pn_y\". Use non-negative integers for absolute bounding polygons, and float values in [0, 1] for normalized bounding polygons.

This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness; for example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of \"java.awt.Color\" in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's \"+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha\" method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS \"rgba()\" string in JavaScript, as well. Note: this proto does not carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications SHOULD assume the sRGB color space. Note: when color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, will treat two colors to be equal if all their red, green, blue and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...
